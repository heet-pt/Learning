Task 1

console.log("First Task");
/*
In the Node.js REPL, I performed the following operations interactively:

1. Basic addition: calculated 2 + 2 and got 4.
2. Converted a string "hello" to uppercase using toUpperCase().
3. Checked the length property of the string.
4. Compared a number and a string with the == operator to see type coercion.

These commands helped me understand how the REPL works with JavaScript expressions and functions.
